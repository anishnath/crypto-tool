To raise the temperature of the gas by a certain amount, heat is to be supplied to increase the average energy of all the modes. Consequently, molar specific heat of diatomic gases is more than that of monatomic gases. It can be shown that if only rotational modes of motion are considered, the molar specific heat of diatomic gases is nearly $\\frac{5}{2}R$ which agrees with the observations for all the gases listed in the table, except chlorine. The higher value of molar specific heat of chlorine indicates that besides rotational modes, vibrational modes are also present in chlorine at room temperature.",

      "**(a) Why high reflectivity → poor emitter:**",
      "**Kirchhoff's Law:** At thermal equilibrium, the ratio of emissive power to absorptive power is same for all bodies",
      "• Good **absorber** = Good **emitter**",
      "• Poor **absorber** = Poor **emitter**",
      "• High **reflectivity** → Low **absorptivity** (most radiation is reflected, not absorbed)",
      "• Therefore: High reflectivity → Poor absorber → Poor emitter",
      "**Example:** Polished metal surfaces (high reflectivity) are poor emitters",
      "**(b) Why brass feels colder than wood:**",
      "**Thermal conductivity:** Brass >> Wood",
      "$k_{brass} \\approx 109$ J s$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$",
      "$k_{wood} \\approx 0.1-0.2$ J s$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$",
      "• When you touch brass, it **conducts heat away from your hand rapidly**",
      "• Wood is a poor conductor, conducts heat slowly",
      "• Brass **feels colder** because your hand loses heat faster",
      "• Both may be at same temperature, but **sensation depends on rate of heat loss**",
      "**(c) Pyrometer reading in open vs. furnace:**",
      "**In the open:**",
      "• Iron is **not a perfect black body** (emissivity $e < 1$)",
      "• Emitted radiation is less than ideal black body at same temperature",
      "• Pyrometer calibrated for black body ($e = 1$) **underestimates** temperature",
      "**In the furnace:**",
      "• Enclosed space with **multiple reflections**",
      "• Radiation reflected many times before escaping",
      "• Acts like a **black body cavity** (effective emissivity $\\approx 1$)",
      "• Pyrometer gives **correct reading**",
      "**(d) Why Earth needs atmosphere:**",
      "**Without atmosphere:**",
      "• No **greenhouse effect** (CO$_2$, H$_2$O vapor, CH$_4$ trap IR radiation)",
      "• Solar radiation absorbed during day",
      "• All heat **radiated back to space at night** (no atmospheric blanket)",
      "• Extreme temperature variations (like Moon: $+127$ °C day, $-173$ °C night)",
      "**With atmosphere:**",
      "• Greenhouse gases absorb and **re-radiate IR** back to Earth",
      "• Maintains relatively **stable, warm temperature** ($\\approx 15$ °C average)",
      "**(e) Steam heating vs. hot water heating:**",
      "**Steam heating:**",
      "• When steam **condenses**: releases **latent heat** $L_v = 2256$ kJ/kg",
      "• Large amount of heat released at **constant temperature** ($100$ °C)",
      "• Example: 1 kg steam condensing releases same heat as cooling 1 kg water from $100$ °C to $\\approx -440$ °C",
      "**Hot water heating:**",
      "• Only **sensible heat** released: $Q = mc\\Delta T$",
      "• Limited by temperature drop",
      "• Less heat per kg of working fluid",
      "**Efficiency comparison:**",
      "Steam system delivers **much more heat per unit mass** due to latent heat"
