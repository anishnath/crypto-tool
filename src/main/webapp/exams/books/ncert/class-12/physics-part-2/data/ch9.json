In what sense then does a magnifying glass provide angular magnification? (b) In viewing through a magnifying glass, one usually positions one's eyes very close to the lens. Does angular magnification change if the eye is moved back? (c) Magnifying power of a simple microscope is inversely proportional to the focal length of the lens. What then stops us from using a convex lens of smaller and smaller focal length and achieving greater and greater magnifying power? (d) Why must both the objective and the eyepiece of a compound microscope have short focal lengths? (e) When viewing through a compound microscope, our eyes should be positioned not on the eyepiece but a short distance away from it for best viewing. Why? How much should be that short distance between the eye and eyepiece?",

      "**(a)**: Though the image subtends the same angle as the object at the lens, the magnifying glass allows the object to be placed much closer than $25$ cm[cite: 141, 142]. Without the lens, an object at $u < D$ would be blurred. The magnification is relative to the angle subtended by the object at the near point ($D$).",
      "**(b)**: Yes. As the eye moves back, the angle subtended by the virtual image at the eye decreases slightly, thus decreasing the angular magnification[cite: 145].",
      "**(c)**: Reducing focal length increases lens thickness and curvature, leading to severe spherical and chromatic aberrations[cite: 21, 147]. Also, extremely small focal length lenses are difficult to manufacture accurately.",
      "**(d)**: For high magnification $m = m_o \\times m_e$. Since $m_o \\approx L/f_o$ and $m_e = D/f_e$, both $f_o$ and $f_e$ must be small to maximize the total magnifying power[cite: 5, 148].",
      "**(e)**: The 'eye-ring' or exit pupil (where all rays from the objective exit the eyepiece) is located slightly beyond the eyepiece[cite: 149]. Positioning the eye at this point allows it to collect the maximum number of rays for a brighter, clearer field of view[cite: 150]."

A small needle with its tip on the principal axis is moved along the axis until its inverted image is found at the position of the needle. The distance of the needle from the lens is measured to be 45.0cm. The liquid is removed and the experiment is repeated. The new distance is measured to be 30.0cm. What is the refractive index of the liquid?",
