# Exercise: Sorting with Lambda
# Task: Sort a list of tuples based on the second element.

points = [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]

# 1. Use the sort() method with a lambda function as the 'key' argument
# to sort the list based on the second number in each tuple.
# points.sort(key = lambda ...)


# 2. Print the sorted list
print(points)
