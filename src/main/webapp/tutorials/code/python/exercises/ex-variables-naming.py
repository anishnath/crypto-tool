# Exercise: Fix the Variable Names
# Some of these variable names are invalid or don't follow Python conventions
# Fix them to make the code run and follow best practices

# TODO: Fix these variable names
# 1st_place = "Gold"      # Invalid - starts with number
# user-name = "alice"     # Invalid - contains hyphen
# MaxValue = 100          # Valid but not Pythonic for a variable
# my constant = 3.14      # Invalid - contains space

# Write your fixed version below:


# After fixing, print all variables:
# print(f"1st place: {???}")
# print(f"Username: {???}")
# print(f"Max value: {???}")
# print(f"Constant: {???}")
