# Exercise: Boolean Logic Practice
# Test your understanding of booleans, comparisons, and logical operators

# Given values:
age = 17
score = 85
has_permission = True
name = ""
items = [1, 2, 3]

# TODO: Predict the result, then uncomment print to verify

# 1. What is: age >= 18
# Your prediction:


# 2. What is: score > 80 and score < 90
# Your prediction:


# 3. What is: age < 18 or has_permission
# Your prediction:


# 4. What is: not has_permission
# Your prediction:


# 5. What is: bool(name)
# Your prediction:


# 6. What is: bool(items)
# Your prediction:


# 7. What is: 10 < age < 20
# Your prediction:


# 8. What is: name or "Anonymous"
# Your prediction:


# 9. What is: items and items[0]
# Your prediction:


# 10. What is: not name and has_permission
# Your prediction:


# Uncomment these to check your answers:
# print(f"1. age >= 18: {age >= 18}")
# print(f"2. score > 80 and score < 90: {score > 80 and score < 90}")
# print(f"3. age < 18 or has_permission: {age < 18 or has_permission}")
# print(f"4. not has_permission: {not has_permission}")
# print(f"5. bool(name): {bool(name)}")
# print(f"6. bool(items): {bool(items)}")
# print(f"7. 10 < age < 20: {10 < age < 20}")
# print(f"8. name or 'Anonymous': {name or 'Anonymous'}")
# print(f"9. items and items[0]: {items and items[0]}")
# print(f"10. not name and has_permission: {not name and has_permission}")
