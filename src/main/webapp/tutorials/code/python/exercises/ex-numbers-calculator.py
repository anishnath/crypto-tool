# Exercise: Simple Calculator
# Implement a calculator that performs all basic operations

# Given two numbers:
num1 = 25
num2 = 7

# TODO: Calculate and print all of the following:
# 1. Addition
# 2. Subtraction
# 3. Multiplication
# 4. Division (regular)
# 5. Integer division
# 6. Modulo (remainder)
# 7. Power (num1 to the power of 2)

# Write your code below:


# Expected output format:
# 25 + 7 = 32
# 25 - 7 = 18
# 25 * 7 = 175
# 25 / 7 = 3.571...
# 25 // 7 = 3
# 25 % 7 = 4
# 25 ** 2 = 625
