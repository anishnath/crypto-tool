# Task: Calculate the sum of numbers in a list and a range.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total_sum = 0

# 1. Use a for loop to calculate the sum of 'numbers' list
# Your code here


print(f"Sum of list: {total_sum}")

# 2. Use a for loop with range() to calculate sum of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
range_sum = 0
# Your code here


print(f"Sum of 1-100: {range_sum}")
