# Exercise: None Type Practice
# Practice working with None values

# Given data:
name = None
age = 25
scores = [85, None, 92, None, 78]
config = {"host": "localhost", "port": None, "debug": True}

# TODO: Complete the following tasks:

# 1. Check if name is None using 'is' (correct way)
# Expected: True


# 2. Provide default value "Guest" if name is None
# Expected: 'Guest'


# 3. Check if age is NOT None
# Expected: True


# 4. Count how many None values are in scores
# Expected: 2


# 5. Get list of scores without None values
# Expected: [85, 92, 78]


# 6. Get the 'port' from config, use 8080 if None
# Expected: 8080


# 7. Get keys from config that have None values
# Expected: ['port']


# 8. Write a function that returns None if input is negative
# and returns the input squared otherwise
# test with: safe_square(-5) and safe_square(5)
# Expected: None, 25


# 9. Check if bool(None) is False
# Expected: True


# 10. Replace None values in scores with 0
# Expected: [85, 0, 92, 0, 78]
