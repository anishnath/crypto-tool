# Exercise: Polymorphism
# Task: Create two classes with the same method name 'sound'.

class Dog:
    # 1. Create a method 'sound' that prints "Woof"
    # Your code here:
    pass

class Cat:
    # 2. Create a method 'sound' that prints "Meow"
    # Your code here:
    pass

# 3. Iterate through a list of animals and call sound()
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals:
    # Call sound()
    pass
