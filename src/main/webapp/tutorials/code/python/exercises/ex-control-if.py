# Exercise: Grading System
# Task: Write a program that determines the grade based on the score.

score = 75
grade = ""

# 1. Write an if-elif-else chain to assign the correct grade:
# 90-100: "A"
# 80-89: "B"
# 70-79: "C"
# 60-69: "D"
# Below 60: "F"

# Your code here:
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
# Add the rest of the logic...


print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")
