# Exercise: Grade Checker
# Use comparison operators to solve these challenges

# Given values
score = 85
age = 17
student1_score = 92
student2_score = 88

# TODO 1: Check if score is passing (>= 60)
is_passing = False  # Replace with your comparison

# TODO 2: Check if score is an A (90-100)
# Hint: Use a chained comparison!
is_grade_a = False  # Replace with your comparison

# TODO 3: Check if age is valid for voting (18 or older)
can_vote = False  # Replace with your comparison

# TODO 4: Check if student 1 scored higher than student 2
student1_higher = False  # Replace with your comparison

# TODO 5: Check if both students have equal scores
scores_equal = False  # Replace with your comparison

# Print results (don't modify these)
print("Is passing:", is_passing)
print("Is grade A:", is_grade_a)
print("Can vote:", can_vote)
print("Student 1 higher:", student1_higher)
print("Scores equal:", scores_equal)
