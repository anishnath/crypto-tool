# Exercise: Calculator Practice
# Use arithmetic operators to solve these calculations

# Given values
length = 15
width = 8
total_items = 100
items_per_box = 12
number = 42
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
years = 3

# TODO 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle (length * width)
area = 0  # Replace with your calculation

# TODO 2: Calculate how many FULL boxes are needed
# Hint: Use floor division (//)
full_boxes = 0  # Replace with your calculation

# TODO 3: Check if 'number' is even
# Hint: A number is even if number % 2 == 0
is_even = False  # Replace with your calculation

# TODO 4: Calculate compound interest
# Formula: A = P(1 + r)^t
# Hint: Use ** for exponentiation
final_amount = 0  # Replace with your calculation

# Print results (don't modify these)
print("Area:", area)
print("Full boxes needed:", full_boxes)
print("Is 42 even?", is_even)
print("Final amount after interest:", final_amount)
