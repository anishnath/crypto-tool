# Exercise: Coordinates
# Task: Work with tuples representing coordinates.

# 1. Create a tuple named 'point' with values (10, 20)
# Your code here:


# 2. Unpack the tuple into variables 'x' and 'y'
# Your code here:


print(f"X: {x}, Y: {y}")

# 3. Try to change the first value of the tuple to 15 (It should fail/raise error, so comment it out after trying)
# point[0] = 15
