# Python Exceptions Basics
# An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

# 1. Syntax Error vs Exception
# Syntax Error: Code is not valid Python (e.g., missing colon)
# Exception: Code is valid, but an error occurs during execution

# 2. Common Exceptions

# ZeroDivisionError
# print(10 / 0)

# TypeError
# print("10" + 5)

# NameError
# print(unknown_variable)

# IndexError
# my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# print(my_list[5])

print("Uncomment the lines above to see the exceptions!")
